Manual of making song files for UltraStar [For version 0.2.1 or high]

1. Files and programs
 - .txt file, where you will write notes and lyrics of song.
 - .mp3 file with song.
 - .midi file with song
 - program to read notes from midi files [ex. Cakewalk pro audio 9 (can be demo version)] + Adobe
audition, Cool Edit or something like that.
 txt and mp3 files should be placed in folder Songs
 ! For version 0.3.0 and high each song has its own subfolder placed in 'Songs' folder!

2. Writing in .txt file

 2.1 Headers
 
    Txt file should contain following headers:
	#TITLE:		[title of song]
	#ARTIST:	[artist ;)]
	#MP3:		[mp3 file name, ex. song.mp3]
	#RELATIVE:yes	[countdown after screen changing begins from 0; it makes work easier]
	#BPM:		[Beats Per Minute, you can check it in various programs for music editing]
	#GAP:		[in miliseconds, distance from beginning of song to beginning of lyrics]

 2.2 Notes
	Every note must be write by a following instructions
	   : time  note_lenght note_tone lyrics
 		explanation:
		  -time countdown begins from 0 in begining of song and changes every screen.
		  -note_lenght: 1 for semiquaver
		  		2 for quaver
				4 for crotchet
				8 for minim
			       16 for full note [?]
		  -note_tone: here we use program for reading notes from midi, the best is to
program showing tone in number - just write it in txt file. You can also count number, C1 is 0.
		  -lyrics: lyrics for note [mostly one note is one syllabe], remember to make a
space after ending each word.


	Example   : 0 2 60 So
		  : 2 2 61 me
		  : 4 4 60 ly
		  : 8 4 65 rics

 2.3 Screen changing [new text line]
	Screen changing is made after each one line of lyrics.
	Close the line by writing:
 	-time_of_screen_end time_of_new_screen
	We count time the same way like notes
          time_of_screen_end - makes ended line to disapear
 	  time_of_new_screen - makes next line to show on screen
	
	Example     : 0 2 60 So
		    : 2 2 61 me
		    : 4 4 60 ly
		    : 8 4 65 rics
		    -12 14
		    : 2 8 58 other
		    : 10 8 56 lyrics
		    -20 22

 2.4 Pauses
	If there is a pause then just add time of pause to time on next note.

 2.5 End of song
	End of song is described by letter E. Write it in new line without anything before it.
Everything after it will be ignored.
